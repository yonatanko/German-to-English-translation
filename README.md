Our German-to-English translation model project, featured in this GitHub repository, combines the T5-base model's multilingual capabilities with specialized fine-tuning for German-to-English translation. Key elements include a focused training strategy, innovative techniques like prompting and tokenization, performance tuning with hyperparameter optimization, and rigorous evaluation using the BLEU metric. A notable innovation is the integration of a pre-trained dependency parsing model for effective root and modifiers extraction, significantly enhancing translation accuracy and contextual comprehension.
